> ## Create a program that, for a given configuration, draws the result of a simulation of motion in a gravitational field.
> Name and surname: Jacek Kozakowski
> Album number: 337248

> The purpose of this project is to be able to simulate and track the movement of objects orbiting around a central object, e.g. the Moon's orbit around the Earth, and save the results to a file that can be loaded later and based on the data contained therein, continue to simulate the movement in orbit starting from the last step of the previous simulation period. The loaded data can also be edited from the program level before the next simulation.

>User manual:
> 1. Install the packages provided in the 'requirements.txt' file
> 2. Run the file 'main.py'
> 3. Choose option:
>    - New simulation: Creates a new simulation based on user-supplied data, with the option to save results
>    - Load simulation: Loads selected previously saved simulation results with the option to continue this simulation
>    - Sample simulations: Simulate one of the selected built-in simulation
> * The program requires **real physical data**
> * To determine the initial position of orbital objects, it is recommended to enter the average distance from the central object and zero for x and y
